            Nowadays, Brandon Sanderson is one of the fantasy writers with most renown around the world, being a New York Times Best Seller many times as this is redacted.

            <li>The Cosmere is the fictional universe he created for many of his fantasy novels to take place within. 
              Currently <em>Elantris, Mistborn, Warbreaker, The Stormlight Archive, White Sand</em>, and anything from 
              <em>Arcanum Unbounded</em> are part of the Cosmere.
            </li>
            <li>
              This idea came from Sanderson's desire to create an epic-length series without requiring readers to buy a 
              ridiculous number of books. Because of that, he hides connections to his other works within each book, 
              creating a "hidden epic". He has estimated that the Cosmere sequence could conclude with at least 40 books.
            </li>
            <li>
              He created Sanderson's Laws of Magic and popularized the idea of "hard magic" and "soft magic" systems.
            </li>
            <li>
              In 2008, Sanderson started a podcast with author Dan Wells and cartoonist Howard Tayler called Writing Excuses, involving topics about creating genre writing and webcomics.
            </li>
            <li>
              In December 2007 Brandon was chosen by Harriet McDougal Rigney to complete Robert Jordanâ€™s 
              <em>Wheel of Time</em> series after his untimely passing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sanderson's March 2022 Kickstarter campaign became the most successful in history, finishing with 185,341 backers pledging $41,754,153 dlls.
